                    Q: How does our grading scale work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Our website evaluates dental health using a grading scale of 1-4, where 1 represents optimal teeth health and 4 represents poor teeth health. The grading system is based on objective and verifiable data points, such as the presence of cavities, gum disease, and other dental conditions. Our AI algorithm analyzes the data and assigns a grade based on the severity of the condition and its impact on dental health. The grading scale is designed to provide a clear and easy-to-understand assessment of dental health, helping users to identify areas of concern and take steps to improve their oral health.
